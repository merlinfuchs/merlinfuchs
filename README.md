# Hi, I'm Merlin! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software engineer from Germany who loves to tinker with new technologies.
Right now I spent a lot of time working with React, TypeScript, and Go.
Every now and then I also like to take on a fight with the Rust compiler.

Currently, I'm working as a part-time software engineer at [Friendly Captcha](https://friendlycaptcha.com),
where we are building a privacy and accessibility focused alternative to Google's reCAPTCHA.

When I'm not working for Friendly Captcha, you will probably find me working on one of my side projects.
This mostly includes building apps around the popular messaging platform [Discord](https://discord.com).
With [Xenon](https://xenon.bot) and [Embed Generator](https://message.style) I'm running two of the biggest apps on the platform and have created a small business around it.
Recently I launched [Kite](https://kite.onl), a no-code platform for building Discord apps.
