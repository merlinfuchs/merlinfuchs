While trying to cross-compile rust from Mac to Linux I ran into a few issues, so I thought I would write a simple guide for myself and anyone else interested. This mainly consists of my own findings and might not work for everyone.

## General steps

To cross-compile from one platform to another, it's usually not enough to just install the standard library for the target using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). You also have to install a linker for the platform and tell `rustc` where to find it.

For some platforms, other dependencies might be necessary as well, but in this article, I will concentrate on compiling from Mac to Linux.

Generally, these are the steps necessary to compile from one platform to another:

- Install the standard library for the target using `rustup target add <target>`
- Install a linker for the platform
- [Update the cargo configuration](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#target) so `rustc` can find the linker
- Set the `TARGET_CC` environment variable to the linker executable during compilation
- Add the target flag to your build command: `cargo build --release --target <target>`

## Choosing the build target

When choosing the right build target I had the choice between `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`.

The `musl` target produces a statically linked binary using the musl C standard library which aims to be very lightweight and simple. The benefit of statically linking the C standard library is that it will run on basically any modern Linux operating system with no dependencies. The drawback is that `musl` is often quite a bit slower than `glibc` and therefore not the optimal choice for many projects.

The `gnu` target on the other hand produces a dynamically linked binary which depends on `glibc` being installed on the host system.

Because `glibc` is often a bit faster than `musl` I decided to go with the `gnu` target. But I will also explain how to build for the `musl` target.

### GNU

The first step is always to install the standard library using `rustup`. This is simply done using `rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`.

But to actually compile to the given target we also need a linker. For this we will use a homebrew formula provided by the community:

```shell
brew install SergioBenitez/osxct/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

Now that the linker is installed we need to tell `rustc` where to find it. This can be done by updating the [.cargo/config.toml](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#hierarchical-structure) and adding the linker for the target:

```toml
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
linker = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc"
```

Now you might already be able to compile to the target using `cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, but for many projects, it will also be necessary to set the `TARGET_CC` environment variable to the linker executable. A full build command could therefore look like this:

```shell
TARGET_CC=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

This is it! You can now cross-compile from Mac to Linux!  
Keep in mind that the produced binary is dynamically linked, so you might need to install other dependencies on the host system to make the executable work.

### MUSL

First, we need to install the standard library using `rustup`. This is simply done by running `rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`.

To actually compile to the given target we also need a linker. For this we will use a homebrew formular provided by the community:

```shell
brew install FiloSottile/musl-cross/musl-cross
```

Now that the linker is installed we need to tell rustc where to find it. This can be done by updating the [.cargo/config.toml](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#hierarchical-structure) and adding the linker for the target:

```toml
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl]
linker = "x86_64-linux-musl-gcc"
```

Now you might already be able to compile to the target using `cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, but for many projects it will also be necessary to set the `TARGET_CC` environment variable to the linker executable. A full build command could therefore look like this:

```shell
TARGET_CC=x86_64-linux-musl-gcc cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

That's it! You can now cross-compile from Mac to Linux.

The produced binary is statically linked and should run on most modern Linux operating systems.
