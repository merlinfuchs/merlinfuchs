# 2025 Copenhagen ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°

<JournalDate startDate="2025-05-14" endDate="2025-05-17" />

Every year the company that I work for invites everyone for a company trip to a new city. This year we spent three days in Copenhagen.

Half of the time was spent in workshops and the other half we had some time getting to know each other and exploring the city. 
We went to the Reffen Street Food Market to eat some food and visited some of the other mandatory sights of the city like the Little Mermaid.

One day we went for a Canoe tour through the canals of the city. It was a great way to see the city from a different perspective and have some fun on the water. 
In the evening we always went out for dinner together and ended the day with a drink.

I always love these trips as it's a great way to build a connection that just isn't possible remotely.
