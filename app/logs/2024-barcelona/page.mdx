# 2024 Barcelona ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸

<JournalDate startDate="2024-11-06" endDate="2024-11-09" />

We spent four days in Barcelona to meet with the whole team of the company. The time was spent getting to know each other, doing workshops, and thinking about the future of the company.

After the workshops, we had some time to explore the city. We visited the Sagrada Familia, the Park GÃ¼ell, and the Barceloneta beach. 
A tour guide we had booked for a private tour of the important sights of the city was the most boring and draining part of the trip.

In the evenings, we went out to eat and drink. Food was plentiful and good, same goes for the drinks. 
A highlight was the Paella cooking class we took where we had to gut the fish and cook the Paella ourselves.

I would go again, but would probably skip the tour guide.
