# 2025 Canada 🇨🇦

I spent two month with my partner road-tripping through Canada! 🏔️ 🦌 🥾 🏕️

In total we drove more than 5,000 km, passing through all kinds of national and provincial parks. Along the way we saw just about every landscape you can imagine: rainforests, waterfalls, (rocky) mountains, glaciers, turquoise lakes… and even some wildlife!

Most nights we camped in our little tent on public campgrounds along the route. The campgrounds themselves were usually pretty rustic (think pit toilets and water pumps) but each site had its own fire pit and picnic bench in a forest clearing. Honestly, much nicer than most European campgrounds I’ve seen. A couple of times we even had views of waterfalls or mountain peaks directly from our tent! Most people came with giant RVs and camper vans, so with our tiny tent and car we often felt a bit out of place.

Despite the endless warning signs about bears, cougars, and wolves, we didn’t exactly have a close encounter with any of them (still can’t decide if that’s a good or a bad thing…). What we did see: killer whales, elks, very photogenic squirrels, ridiculously cute pikas, and even one small bear that casually crossed the road in front of our car! I was sadly too slow to make picture :(

The second month we spent in Calgary, the second-biggest city in Western Canada. My partner did an internship at a local primary school, and I just worked from there. 
The time zone difference (-8h) made work tricky at times, but it was a great experience to work from a different country.
