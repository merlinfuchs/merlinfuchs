# 2025 Gr√∏nolen üá≥üá¥

I spent a week in Gr√∏nolen, Norway, with family, and let me tell you‚Äîit was a winter wonderland straight out of a postcard.

Most of the days were spent gliding through the snow on nordic skis and enjoying the beautiful nature. The views over the snowy mountains, valleys, and frozen lake were amazing.

We stayed in a hotel which was pretty much in the middle of nowhere. The hotel with its sauna and whirl pool was a great place to relaxe after a few hours of skiing.
We got great breakfast and dinner which consisted of a lot of fish, meat and veggies. Delicious, but by the end of the week I was ready for some a change ...

While the area is most suitable for nordic skiing we also went snowboarding two times. 
There are only a few slopes with two lifts so a few hours were more than enough to give every possible descent a try. üèÇ

One day we went ice bathing in a small pond close to the hotel. The hotel owner had cut a hole in the ice with a nice view over the frozen lake below.
Probably not my brightest moment going into the freezing water while already battling a cold ...

On the last day we went for a snowshoe hike up a nearby mountain. The path up was steep, the snow pretty deep in some parts but the views over the other mountains and the frozen lake were amazing.
The dog of the hotel owner joined us for the hike - definitely the most energetic member of the group.

Norway isn't exactly the cheapest country to visit, but we had a great and relaxing time!
