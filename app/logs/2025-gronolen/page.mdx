I spent a week in GrÃ¸nolen, Norway with family. 

Most of the days were spent exploring the area using nordic ski and enjoying the beautiful nature. The views over the snowy mountains, valleys, andfrozen lake were breathtaking.

We stayed in a hotel which was located in the middle of nature above a lake. The hotel with its sauna and whirl pool was a great place to relaxe after a day of skiing.
The hotel provided breakfast and dinner which consisted of a lot of fish, meat and vegetables. The food was great overall even if it was similar every day.

While the area is mostly known for nordic skiing we also went snowboarding two times. 
There are only a few slopes with two lifts so a few hours were more than enough to explore every possible descent.

One day I went ice bathing in small pond close to the hotel. The hotel owner had cut a hole in the ice. 
Not sure if it was the best idea going into the freezing water because I was already sick with a cold ...

On the last day we went for a snowshoe hike up a mountain nearby. The path up was steep and the snow pretty deep in some parts. 
The dog of the hotel owner joined us for the hike. The views over the other mountains and the frozen lake were amazing.

Even though Norway isn't the cheapest country to visit, I would recommend visiting it during the winter. The nature is beautiful and the skiing is great.
