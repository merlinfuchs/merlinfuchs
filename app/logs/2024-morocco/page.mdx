# 2024 Morocco ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¦

<JournalDate startDate="2024-03-09" endDate="2024-03-22" />

Me and my girlfriend went for a rail trip through Morocco. We started in Marrakech and drove through the country to the north and then back. We visited the cities of Casablanca, Rabat, Fes, Chefchaouen, Marrakech, and Essaouira.

The cities were full of life and the people were friendly even if they just wanted to sell us something. The markets called _Souks_ were a highlight and offered a wide variety of goods and food.
Sadly we couldn't try any food from the market as we didn't want to risk getting food poisoning.

Travelling by train was surprisingly easy and comfortable. The trains were clean and climatized, let's just ignore the fact that the bathrooms consisted of a hole in the ground.
Because we travelled during Ramadan, the train staff even gave us free water and food as soon as the sun went down.

At first we thought Ramadan would be a big problem for us as we wouln't feel comfortable eating in public and thought many restaurants would be closed.
After all it wasn't a big problem as most people didn't mind us eating or drinking in public and many restaurants were open for tourists anyway.

We also did a tour through the Atlas Mountains where we stopped at some beautiful waterfalls, visited a Berber village, and got climbed on by Barbary apes. Another night we spent in a nice hotel in Essaouira which is a city by the ocean. It was a great contrast to the rest of the trip.

The last evening we spent in the Agafay Desert where we went on a camel ride, had a nice dinner, and a _interactive_ dance show. It was a great way to end the trip!

The trip was a great experience and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a little adventure!
I'm not sure if I would go a second time as I really don't miss the constant smell from the _Souks_ ...
