# 2023 Madeira ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹

<JournalDate startDate="2023-03-01" endDate="2023-03-13" />

After I spent a month alone on Madeira in 2021, I decided to go back and show my partner the island. We spent two weeks on the island and rented a car to explore the island.

We visited the north, south, east, and west. We went to the beaches, the mountains, the valleys, and the cities. When not driving, we went hiking alongside the Levada trails which are the main way to traverse the island by foot.

I love the island for its moderate climate, the beautiful nature, good vibes, and how easy it is to get around. Even though it is a small island, it has a rich diversity of landscapes and climates. The humid subtropical climate in the mountains is a good contrast to the sunny beaches at the coast.

Two weeks are enough to see the highlights of the island, but there is obviously way more to explore! I would love to go back at some point to revisit the places we have seen and the ones we have missed.
